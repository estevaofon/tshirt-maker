## :space_invader: About

This code uses the `PIL` library to open an image of a t-shirt and an image of a graphic to be applied to the t-shirt. It then uses the `rembg` library to remove the background of the graphic image. The code resizes the graphic to fit on the t-shirt, centers and pastes the graphic onto the t-shirt image, and saves the new image as a PNG file.
